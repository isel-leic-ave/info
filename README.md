#### Description
A considerable amount of contemporary software is targeted to run in some
instance of a software-mediated execution environment, usually called a *managed
runtime environment* or a *virtual execution environment*. 
The [Java Virtual Machine](https://openjdk.org/groups/hotspot) (JVM),
originally designed to run software written in Java, is one of such environments
and is currently a target for other relevant programming languages, such as
Kotlin, Scala, Groovy or Clojure. 
Microsoft has its own managed runtime, the 
[.NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime),
which is the natural target for several .NET languages and presents many similar characteristics and functionalities to those of the JVM.

In this course unit, we explore these kind of execution enviroments, the
programming languages that target them, and programming techniques that take
full advantage of the capabilities that they expose.
During the semester, you will work in groups to complete coursework assignments
that will allow you to explore the capabilities and techniques of managed
runtime environments, with a focus on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Those assignments provide you with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience
in implementing frameworks similar to industry-standard ones, such as the
[AutoRouter](https://github.com/isel-leic-ave/autorouter) (inspired by Spring MVC),
[Jsonaif](https://github.com/isel-leic-ave/jsonaif) (inspired by Jackson JSON),
or AutoMapper, among others.

You will use both Java and Kotlin as programming languages, exploring their
interoperability within the JVM ecosystem. 
Throughout the course, you will also become familiar with tools that enable you
to evaluate and analyze the performance and behavior of software running in these
environments.

#### Prerequisites
* Good working knowledge of Java or Kotlin, with at least two semesters (but ideally three) of practical experience developing software with one of these languages. Equivalent solid knowledge of Scala or C# is also acceptable, but may require more effort to adapt.
* We expect students to be familiar with basic computer architecture, IP networks and essential web technologies. Although these are not central topics in this course unit, they may appear in examples and to support discussions, as well as be a part of coursework assignments.
