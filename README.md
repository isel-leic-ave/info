#### Description
A considerable amount of contemporary software is targeted to run in some instance of software mediated execution environment, usually called a *managed runtime environment* or a *virtual execution environment*. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), originally designed to run software written in Java, is one of such environments and is currently a target for other relevant programming languages, such as Kotlin, Scala, Groovy or Clojure. Microsoft has its own managed runtime, the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is the natural target for several .NET languages, presenting many similar characteristics and functionalities to those of the JVM. In this course unit, we explore these kind of execution enviroments, the programming languages that target them, and programming techniques that take full advantage of the capabilities that they expose.

During the semester, you will work in groups to complete coursework assignments that allow you to explore these capabilities and techniques, using the JVM as the main runtime environment, and using both Java and Kotlin as programming languages, also exploring their interoperability. Along the way, you will get familiar with tools to evaluate and analyze the performance and behaviour of software running in this environment.

#### Prerequisites
* Good working knowledge of Java or Kotlin, with at least two semesters (but ideally three) of practical experience developing software with one of these languages. Equivalent solid knowledge of Scala or C# is also acceptable, but may require more effort to adapt.
* We expect students to be familiar with basic computer architecture, IP networks and essential web technologies. Although these are not central topics in this course unit, they may appear in examples and to support discussions, as well as be a part of coursework assignments.
